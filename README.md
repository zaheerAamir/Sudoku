# SUDOKU SOLVER:

Project Website: https://sdoku-solver.netlify.app

this is a basic sudoku solver, a user will be able to enter the input 
numbers from 1 to 9 on the board and when the user will click the solve button
the frontend will give a call to the api and the board will be filled with the 
correct solution according to the input given.

Used NODE.js to design the backend of the website and 
to design the client side (Frontend) used htmls,css and js

Used packages like express,cheerio,dotenv,cors and axios

Temporarily the site is down because the backend of the site is deployed in Heroku
